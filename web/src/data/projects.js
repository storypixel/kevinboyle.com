    description: 'Every morning, I found myself doing mental math to dial in my espresso shots. The existing apps felt clinical and forgettable. BrewDial was born from wanting a tool that matched the craftsmanship of specialty coffee.',
    workDescription: 'The Art Deco aesthetic was intentional. Espresso culture has roots in early 20th century European cafes. The gold on dark brown palette, geometric patterns, and vintage typography create an experience that feels timeless rather than utilitarian. The real-time shot timer with visual feedback helps baristas nail the extraction window.',

    description: 'Typography systems in design tools always felt disconnected from implementation. Designers would create beautiful scales that developers then approximated. TypeScale bridges that gap with mathematical precision.',
    workDescription: 'The Swiss brutalist aesthetic honors the tradition of systematic typography from the International Typographic Style. Each ratio from Minor Second to Golden Ratio creates mathematically harmonious relationships. The live preview shows exactly how text will render, and the CSS export means developers get pixel perfect implementation.',

    description: 'Accessibility tools are often the most boring applications imaginable. Gray interfaces checking if your colors are accessible enough. The irony was too much. PalettePop proves accessibility tooling can have personality.',
    workDescription: 'The vaporwave/cyberpunk aesthetic with CRT scanlines and neon colors makes contrast checking actually enjoyable. The tool calculates ratios against WCAG 2.1 standards instantly, showing both AA and AAA compliance for normal and large text.

    description: 'Modern country information apps felt sterile. Lists of data without soul. Atlas reimagines this as a beautiful compendium, like the encyclopedias and atlases that sparked wonder in generations past.',
    workDescription: 'The Victorian/archival aesthetic with aged paper textures, ornate borders, and serif typography transforms dry data into discovery. Each nation becomes a collectible card with flag, region, capital, and population. The instant search filters 250+ territories while maintaining the sense of browsing through an old world atlas.',

    description: 'Standing at the gym rack doing plate math in my head was error prone and slow. Existing calculators showed text, not plates. PlateMath visualizes exactly which plates go on each side, eliminating mental overhead during workouts.',
    workDescription: 'The industrial aesthetic with diamond plate textures, caution stripes, and mechanical styling reflects the gym environment. The visual barbell shows plates to scale, making loading intuitive. Quick presets for common weights and seamless LBS/KG conversion support both powerlifting and Olympic lifting standards.',

    description: 'Nutrition apps are overwhelming. Barcode scanners, restaurant databases, premium subscriptions. MacroMini strips it down to essentials: add common foods, adjust portions, see your macros. No account required, no data harvesting.',
    workDescription: 'The 70s retro aesthetic with warm earth tones, rounded shapes, and playful copy makes tracking feel less like homework. The donut chart shows macro balance at a glance. Sliding portion sizes provides instant feedback. The focus on whole foods encourages healthier choices without the guilt trip of calorie counting apps.',
